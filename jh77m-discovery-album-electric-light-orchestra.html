I often see people asking where to start when getting into prog metal, so I thought instead of answering every one of them individually I'd make a list. I'm not going into too much depth because otherwise this will become endless, but I'll try to give a brief explanation of all styles I'm going over. So let's get started! ampnbsp; #Part 0: Some information on the genre and motivation Since this guide got as huge as it did, I felt it was necessary to write a better introd.

The money is going toward my wife's medical bills, so I'm not really interested in serious haggling.
