                            <p> As the title suggests, this is a list of the playability of most official Sonic the Hedgehog games (and a few that aren't official) on PC. Note that "playable on PC" means "Can I play this on some modern desktop OS without owning the console?" Why did I decide to make this? Beats me. It was originally meant to be games in the main series, but eventually it snowballed into this abomination. Hopefully the mods are cool with it, since a major portion of it is an (admittedly somewhat shallow). 1) Plan all of your farms out ahead of time. 2) Focus on generating passive forms of income. ( arenas ; raids ) 3) Bounty hunters get you two legendarys and clear credit heist. Get them 4) Start the farm, finish the farm. 5) Treat your resources like real life currency. Save a portion of them for a rainy day or a new event. 6) Speaking of which save 5-20k crystals if possible at all times. 7) Early in shards farming the counter meta (I e Rex into pAlp) 
TL;DR: Macro for 2,196,998 EXP/hour amp#x200B; Now with uploaded video (https://youtu.be/kMs-sn7QJzk) amp#x200B; Preface: I personally created this specifically for Another Eden because I enjoy the game, mostly the storytelling, and I am a father of a toddler and don't have much time to grind. I personally feel safe farming with a macro because this does not change any game files which can be easily detected by devs. Bigger games like FFBE allows for macro touch recording as their 3-11-19 Hello Everyone! The Release was a tremendous success, with hundreds giving very positive feedback! Of course, as with anything, there may be a few issues to contend with, things to fix up, etc! I will take several of the suggestions, comments, messages into account! Expect another follow-up Release within a few days for some more bigger, badder, better than ever stuff for your Mini NES/SNES/PSC! Thanks again, all of you!!! And, on a special side note.Every April Fool's. I really wanted to know. I struggle with depression all the time. amp#x200B; amp#x200B; I look back on my life and really wonder if I can keep going. I feel so terrible about simply being myself and how I have no reason to live. amp#x200B; amp#x200B; No, no, I'm never considering suicide. I have a family I Skype with. I have video games on emulation. I have Netflix. I have YouTube. I have DVDs. I have Disney cartoons. I have anime. I have CDs. I have music Disclosure: I personally believe pc is the superior platform. amp#x200B; Objective: amp#x200B; To help those who are considering to switch from PC gaming to console gaming and vice versa. amp#x200B; To have a rational discussion about pros and cons about PC and console gaming and end this debate forever. It’s time we have a good discussion about this rather screaming ‘pc master race’ on every forum(I am looking at those youtube commenters). amp#x200B; # MAME 0.206 (https://www.mamedev.org/?p=465) Welcome to 2019 – we’re starting the year with a bang! MAME 0.206 is an absolutely huge update when it comes to new dumps and newly working software, especially when it comes to TV games. As far as we know, MAME is the first V.Smile emulator with working controls and the most compatible, with almost all dumped titles fully playable for one player (the second joystick isn’t working yet). A number of JAKKS Pacific games based on similar technology. EDIT: I found a way to get sound working very easily. Check it out at the bottom. I've been looking for a way to get this done for so long. Here's how to reproduce what worked for me. There is a way, found at the bottom of this post, to do this for free. Personally, I used the paid Buildstore method. First, I purchased a buildstore subscription for about  from buildstore (https://builds.io). Then I downloaded iDos. Once I had this installed to my iPad, I downloaded this DOS rom (http. PowerISO 7.4 Serial Key is the program that allows you to create, convert, unpack, compress, edit and encrypt CD / DVD images, as well as open them using the built-in emulator, besides this awesome windows application supports work with all major image formats: ISO, BIN, NRG, CDI, DAA, MDF, BWI, B5I, LCD, CIF, P01, PDI, NCD, PXI, GI, FCD, VCD, C2D. amp#x200B; Download: https://prokeysz.net/poweriso-serial-key (https://prokeysz.net/poweriso-serial-key) amp#x200B; amp#x200B;. I used to visit his groceries store to pass time. He in his free time used to play PS1 games on his PC(i think he used an emulator idk lol) which games where in the CDs if i recall correctly. So one day, my mom bought a Laptop and she used to let me play in it(it din’t have internet though) then i bored, discovered that the Laptop could read Cds, i got very excited, thinking that i would be able to play those flashy games that my neighbor played in his pc. Then the day came, i wasn’t really. Before I start I just want to Clarify this is just my opinion. If you have a different opinion that's awesome and I would love to hear you in the comments section. I love talking to people who have different opinions. I think it's also important to note that I have no nostalgia for the Atari Jaguar or any of 16 bit (4th gen SNES, Genesis/or Megadrive) or 32/64 bit (5th gen PS, Saturn N64). I grew up playing GameCube and didn't know anyone (including myself) who owned one. I've owned my Jaguar. 
So, my family had two Windows 98SE computers from the late 1990s through the mid 2000s. Now, my family being who they are, basically only got educational programs, office software, edutainment games, crappy activity centers, barbie games, stupid interactive stories (usually interactive storybooks), what ever we got free in cereal boxes and hardware packages, a few shareware compilation CDs (mostly from Lucas Arts), what ever the OEM/Microsoft had installed on Windows by default Recently I bought the ad-free IAPs for Sonic 2 and Sonic CD and holy hell, are these the best  I've spent on mobile games. This just sparked my curiosity for more retro games on the AppStore. I know the rest of the SEGA Forever games are really wonky. But I want to ask, once you buy the ad-free IAP, does the performance on those games improve? Because I don't know if the emulator itself is actually garbage, or the games drop frames because the app is pre-loading ads in the background. Computer game emulators are software application that permit your computer to function as a video game console and also play games that are saved as ROM documents. Emulators for prominent systems such as N64, SNES, NES, PS1, Video game boy, Sega can be found on multiple sites as well as are usually readily available for free downloading. Of course, The ROM documents can constantly be found nearby. This makes them have to own software program for any type of hardcore gamer, especially Hello fellow FFBE players. I'm writting this guide for players that intend to reroll to get their hands on 2B, or that are just seeking a strong starter. #Should I reroll ? Let's preface this guide with why you should (or not reroll), and why I rerolled. Ultimately it's only about you, you are the one who decide, but you can always seek advice on the daily help thread which is a great ressource. The main reason to reroll is to experience powercreep, and often because you can get something. # MAME 0.205 (https://www.mamedev.org/?p=464) With Christmas just over, it’s time for the final MAME release for 2018, and what a year it’s been! Before we move on, let’s pause and recap some of the significant milestones from the past twelve months: We’ve emulated a steady stream of hand-held games from Nintendo, Tiger and others. Our Tiger Game.com emulation now runs all released games. Acorn computer emulation improvements have been too numerous to count. In particular 
Hello everyone I very recently purchased myself an xbox 360 Dev unit! I am extremely familiar with how 360s work inside and out, I've spent many years repairing them for people and last year I even had my Falcon model J-Tagged and I absolutely do not regret it. Its given me a whole new love for the system. I am also a HUGE halo fan and have even been working on some mod projects for a couple specific halo games in my free time. Mainly experimenting but that isn't the point of this thread I'd like to know what games you play on RetroPie that may be off the beaten path a bit, whether or not it's a lesser known game or maybe on an emulator people would assume does not work well on the Raspberry Pi. There are no wrong answers here, of all the thousands of options you may have to play, there are countless games that get lost in the shuffle and deserve some attention. I have several that I would like to share, so buckle up. I use a Pi 3B, but feel free to discuss whichever Notice that, although the emulators are written for DOS, they will run in a DOS-box in Windows EmuCR.Com.
